# headtoicu

[headto.icu](https://headto.icu) is a website that is created during a period when **Francie Jiang** dared not to use a VPN to watch videos on YouTube.

She thought that with her current mental and physical health situation, she'll eventually head to ICU. Therefore, she searched for the domain name `headto.icu` just out of curiosity, which turned out to be cheap to register. She registered it at once and designed the web pages for two hours for releasing them on [Vercel](https://vercel.app).

She may use this domain name for things that are more meaningful or entertaining (i.e. use it other than an alternative of Twitter or Mastodon), such as posting some articles on it or make it a social media platform that is free (as in **free speech**) and open.
